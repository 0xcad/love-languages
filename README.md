## Reimagining the English Syntax Trees as a Turing Complete Language

*Abstract.* This project reimagines the syntax structure of the English language as a Turing Complete
programming language. I present a schema to convert syntax trees into Brainfuck (bf) programs. Under
this schema, I then explore two approaches for converting bf programs into syntax trees that represent
functionally-equivalent programs. A final algorithm assigns words to completed syntax trees, generating executable sentences, and connects the results and processes of this project to Christopher Stracheyâ€™s Love Letter Algorithm. This positions my programming Love Language as a response to one of the first examples of computer-generated literature and as an instance of queer computer art itself.

The code is in `src`. Run the executable with `python main.py`.
