# What is X-bar theory?
* Rules that dictate which nodes can follow which
* Recursive
* Implies turing complete?

# Well known homosexual: Alan Turing
* What is Turing Complete

# Syntax Trees => Programming Language
Idea; Encode x-bar rules with bf instrutions. A program is then (somewhat arbitrarily) the in-order traversal of a syntax tree and the corresponding rules associated with each node

The words themselves do not matter, only the shape of their syntax trees
* the words are therefore less important than their arrangement; ambiguity is a problem for words, not their trees

Idea: Programming language whose syntax is the syntax of the English Language

# Problems
1. Arrange rules in such a way that there is a mapping from valid program => valid syntactical sentences
2. Given a desired program, find a way to combine rules so that the ecnoded program is funcitonally equivalent to the program
3. Assign words to syntactical sentences to map programs onto the English language

# 1. Arrange rules
Going to use bf to do this

Observations
* `+-><` can be negateed, but not commutatively
* `,.[]` cannot be
* Sometimes certain rules force us to use other rules `=>` I Could not find a way to map rules so that  single sentence can encode an arbitrary program
    * Ex: adjectives always have to come before nouns, verbs always have to come after the first DP, sentence always needs a DP and VP
* Idea: have "structural" parts of language be reversible `<>` rules, have optional parts be everything else
* Quick observation: In typical bf program most operations repeated more than once so assign rules multiple operations at once for efficient encoding

# 2. Combine rules into program

# 3. Assign words
